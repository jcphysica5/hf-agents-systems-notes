# Experiments

This section collects standalone experiments and projects that go beyond the course material.

## How to add an experiment

1. Create a notebook in `notebooks/experiments/`
2. Add a new `.md` page in `docs/experiments/`
3. Link to the notebook (Colab badge or local path)
4. Register the new page in `mkdocs.yml` under the `Experiments` nav section
